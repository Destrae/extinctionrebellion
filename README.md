## About Extinction Rebellion (XR)

Extinction Rebellion is a movement of non violent mass direct action of civil disobedience for the climate.
More info on http://rebellion.earth

It is a self organized organization. There is no hierarchy. We split into working groups that have mandates.
See this [video about Power, Decision Making & Strategy in Extinction Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsh5eWVksCE) and on [the 10 principles of XR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6se6c5qvuV4).

## Why being on Github?

We all have something to contribute to the movement. 
Right now, a lot of the rebellion is using Spreadsheets left and rights by lack of dedicated tools. 
It has been good enough for now but it doesn't scale. It's a mess.
As the movement grows, we need to develop dedicated tools.

We have a GitLab instance (https://code.organise.earth).
But most open source developers are on Github. So we also want to make sure that we can tap into this great community.

## Current stack

List of the tools that the movement is currently using:

- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com): slack alternative (open source)
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/): self hosted forum softare (open source)
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com): project management software
- [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com): messaging app
- [Signal](https://signal.org/): secure messaging app (open source)
- Google Docs / Spreadsheets
- [Framapad](https://framapad.org/): google doc alternative for real time editing
- [Framadate](https://framadate.org/): doodle.com alternative (open source)
- [MailTrain](https://mailtrain.org/): self hosted newsletter app (open source)
- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com): google drive alternative (open source)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com): self hosted github alternative (open source)
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com): transparent expense management and fundraising (open source)
- [Xero](https://xero.com): accounting software

So contributing to the tools listed there that are open source is already a great way to contribute to the movement!
For the non open source tools, finding ways to connect them with other more open source tools would be useful. 

Beyond those tools, the movement is also making extensive use of social platforms (mainly Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).

## What is needed?

Our absolute priority is to get as many rebels willing to participate in direct actions of civil disobedience for the climate emergency. Everything we do should be to support them and the organization.

### Tools for outreach and onboarding

The immediate need that some rebels have already started working on is a tool for local chapters to manage a database of rebels (RebelsManager). Right now people use spreadsheets and it's not ideal.

### Tools for open and transparent finance
The other area where spreadsheets are heavily used is finance. On top of not being ideal and error prone, it is also really hard to make it transparent.

A couple of local chapters use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) (see https://opencollective.com/extinctionrebellion) but in its current form, it doesn't work in all countries (it's limited by [countries where Stripe operates](https://stripe.com/global)). Given that it's open source, we could fork the software to meet the needs of XR and offer it for free to the local chapters.
The main XR UK is using [Xero](https://xero.com).

### Tools for documentation
As the organization is growing, there is more and more knowledge being created. We should make sure that it not lost.
There is already a gazillion of google docs left and right but no single point that bring them all together.

It would be great to have a wiki for this.

## How to contribute?

All are welcome who want to adhere to [our principles and values](https://github.com/extinctionrebellion/extinctionrebellion/blob/master/principles.md).

We are still figuring out what would be the best process to contribute.
For now, the best is probably to introduce yourself by posting an issue to this repo.
Tell us about you, your skills and what you would love to do.

With love and rage!

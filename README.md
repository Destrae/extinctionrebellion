## About Extinction Rebellion (XR)

Extinction Rebellion is a movement of non violent mass direct action of civil disobedience for the climate.
More info on http://rebellion.earth

It is a self organized organization. There is no hierarchy. We split into working groups that have mandates.
See this [video about Power, Decision Making & Strategy in Extinction Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsh5eWVksCE) and on [the 10 principles of XR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6se6c5qvuV4).

## Why being on Github?

We all have something to contribute to the movement. 
Right now, a lot of the rebellion is using Spreadsheets left and rights by lack of dedicated tools. 
It has been good enough for now but it doesn't scale. It's a mess.
As the movement grows, we need to develop dedicated tools.

We have a GitLab instance (https://code.organise.earth).
But most open source developers are on Github. So we also want to make sure that we can tap into this great community.

## How to contribute?

We are still figuring out what would be the best process to contribute.
For now, the best is probably to introduce yourself by posting an issue to this repo.
Tell us about you, your skills and what you would love to do.
